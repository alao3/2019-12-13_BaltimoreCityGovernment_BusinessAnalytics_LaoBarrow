# Illegal Dumping in Baltimore City

# Abstract
Overall, illegal dumping 311 Reporting and related Environmental Citations are increasing. For 311 Reporting, API/Phone are the most common reporting style, however the reporting style does not affect the total number of citations per district. Through a cluster analysis that identified specific neighborhoods with the highest reports and citations in Baltimore, the suggested targeted interventions include improving communication and transparency with reporters, modifying the current surveillance system, and implementing a cash reward program. Future research includes comparing this data with demolition data, updating 311 data in a timely and accurate manner, and understanding how seasonality affects 311 reporting as well.
