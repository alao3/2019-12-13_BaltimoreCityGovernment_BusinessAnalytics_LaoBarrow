# Illegal Dumping in Baltimore City

# Problem Statement
Illegal trash dumping is a growing problem in Baltimore City--the Department of Housing and Community Development issued almost 1,150 citations for illegal dumping in 2018, however, there isn’t much insight into why this is happening and what we can do about it. We’d like to better understand the trends that help explain illegal dumping in Baltimore City, and explore potential interventions that can help prevent illegal dumping.

# Why is this a Challenge/Problem?
Illegal dumping in Baltimore 

# Solution
## Process

In our midterm project, we analyzed whether or not Baltimore had a trash problem. Through our findings, we wanted to identify geographic hot spots that had the highest trash accumulation. 

Now, this project allows us to dive deeper into a specific environmental trash problem: illegal dumping. Our approach is two fold: first, we wanted to find trends in 311 Reporting and the number of Environment Citations, as well as possible relationships between the two datasets. In addition, we wanted to analyze seasonal trends to see if Balitmore City needed to take more action or implement different strategies during specific points of the year.

Second, identifying geographic hotspots of high illegal citations and reporting will give insight into specific areas to target on a city council district level and neighborhood level. By identifying 'hot spots', we hope to advise the city to focus on specific areas first to mitigate the ramifications of illegal dumping.

## Findings
PART 1: We analyzed the 311 reports and environmental citations annually, seasonally, and geographically. 
### 311 Findings
Annually we see an increase in the annual number reports from 2014 (2889 citations) to 2019 (10,269 citations).

Seasonally, basis, we also see an increase in the late summer/early fall months from July to September, with the highest number of reports in August from 2014-2019.

Geographically, District 9 had the highest number of illegal dumping 311 reports (5877) across all years.   

At this point, we diverted to answer an additional question - Does baltimore have more efficient reporting methods that led to increased reporting? Or is Baltimore becoming dirtier? Therefore, we analyzed the methods for how to report 311 citations, and found that API and Phone were the highest. 

Reporting methods include email, mail, phone, system, and web. Across all years, API and Phone had the highest number of reports, with Phone being consistently higher than API. We wanted to see if the type of reporting had any effect on an increase or decrease in reports. By identifying the District API:Phone ratio compared to the number of reports, we created a scatter plot - the findings were that although there is higher phone use, it doesn't necessarily lead to more or less citations, lower API:PHONE ratios resulted in both high and low reports in multiple districts. Therefore, the method of reporting doesn't affect reporting quantities, but overall there is still an increase in reporting over the years.

To see if Baltimore is becoming dirtier beyond illegal dumping, we looked at 311 reports that were related such as bulk scheduled, clean up, cleaning, dirty alley, dirty street. By removing the irrelevant subsections, we wanted to compare All Dumping to All Bulk Pickup, All Cleaning, and All Dirty Alley and Streets citations. Overall, Cleaning, Dumping, and Bulk Pickup remained stagnant over the 5 years, however there was a dramatic decrease for Dirty Alley and Streets. 

Overall, reporting is increasing but the illegal dumping + additional related reports are stagnant, with some even decreasing, so we do not think the city is getting dirtier - rather, people are being more proactive and seem to report more, which has been effective in some cases, specifically with 

### Environmental Citations Findings 

PART 2: After analyzing these two datasets, we wanted to better understand the relationship between the two.


## Future Analysis/What we still need to do
 We still need to do a more narroy analysis

## Problems we faced/forsee
- After the first meeting with city government, we realized the data we downloaded was inaccurate, leading us to obtain very skewed and inaccurate results.
- After redowloading the data, we got better results for the 311 citations, however we are still having trouble identifying accurate data for environmental citations. As a result, we will use data related to 'illegal dumping' to understand the general trash/dumping problem.

# Additional Sources Baltimore Open Data
We used the Environmental Citations and 311 Reporting Data from the open data website.
