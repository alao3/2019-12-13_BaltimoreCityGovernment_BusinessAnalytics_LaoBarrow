# Illegal Dumping in Baltimore City

# Abstract
Overall, illegal dumping 311 Reporting and related Environmental Citations are increasing. For 311 Reporting, API and Phone were the most common reporting styles, however the reporting style does not affect the total number of citations per district. Through a cluster analysis that identified specific neighborhood ‘hotspots’ with the highest reports and citations in Baltimore, the suggested targeted interventions include improving communication and transparency with reporters, modifying the current surveillance system, and implementing a cash reward program. Additional research includes comparing trash drop off centers to the hotspots, analyzing the effects of population change, and comparing the hot spots results to demolition/construction data.

# Data Visualizations
Our approach is two fold: first, we wanted to find trends from the 311 Reporting and the Environmental Citations datasets, and identify the relationships between the two datasets. Second, we identified ‘hotspots’ with high illegal citations and reports, which give insight into specific areas to target on a city council district level and neighborhood level. 

311 Reporting: The number of 311 reports increase annually from 2014 (2,889 citations) to 2019 (10,269 citations).

To dive deeper, we wanted to better understand if Baltimore has more efficient reporting methods that led to increased reporting, or if Baltimore was becoming dirtier? Of all reporting styles (API, email, mail, phone, system, and web), API and Phone had the highest number of reportings, with Phone being consistently higher than API.

The data collected for illegal dumping citations was inaccurate and corrupted. As a compromise, we focused on citations similar to illegal dumping, including Trash Accumulation and Bulk Trash citations. From 2004-2019, there is an exponential increase for both citations, again confirming the magnitude of the trash problem.

Through the analysis, five clusters were identified: Abell (1), Canton (2), Better Waverly (3)  Belair Edison (4), and Broadway East (5) . By utilizing the 311 dashboard, we mapped out the clusters with the top number of reporting and citations, which were Clusters 4  and Cluster 5. Cluster 4 was entirely Belair Edison, Cluster 5 was made up of 13 neighborhoods (outside red circle, including Baltimore Highlands, Broadway East, Brooklyn, Carrollton Ridge, Central Park Heights, Coldstream Homestead Montebello, Ellwood Park/Monument, McElderry Park, Patterson Park, Washington Village/Pigtown). Overall, there is a high concentration of high illegal dumping/trash occurences in the NW region of Baltimore.

By comparing the trash Drop Off center locations (marked in red below) to the hotspots we found that all of the hotspot neighborhoods we had identified are within 3 miles of the city’s 8 legal dumping sites, the average distance between the sites and these neighborhoods being 1.7 miles. Central Park Heights (NW region) has 2 drop off centers within the neighborhood itself. This highly suggests that there may be trash overflow around these drop off centers, leading to high numbers of 311 reports and environmental citations.
