# Illegal Dumping in Baltimore City

# Problem Statement
Illegal trash dumping is a growing problem in Baltimore City--the Department of Housing and Community Development issued almost 1,150 citations for illegal dumping in 2018, however, there isn’t much insight into why this is happening and what we can do about it. We’d like to better understand the trends that help explain illegal dumping in Baltimore City, and explore potential interventions that can help prevent illegal dumping.

# Solution
Process

In our midterm project, we analyzed whether or not Baltimore had a trash problem. Through our findings, we wanted to identify geographic hot spots that had the highest trash accumulation. 

Now, this project allows us to dive deeper into a specific environmental trash problem: illegal dumping. Our approach is two fold: irst, we wanted to find trends in 311 Reporting and the number of Environment Citations, as well as possible relationships between the two datasets. In addition, we wanted to analyze seasonal trends to see if Balitmore City needed to take more action or implement different strategies during specific points of the year.

Second, identifying geographic hotspots of high illegal citations and reporting will give insight into specific areas to target on a city council district level and neighborhood level. By identifying 'hot spots', we hope to advise the city to focus on specific areas first to mitigate the ramifications of illegal dumping.
