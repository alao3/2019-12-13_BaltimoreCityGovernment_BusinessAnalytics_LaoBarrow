# Illegal Dumping in Baltimore City

# Abstract
Overall, illegal dumping 311 Reporting and related Environmental Citations are increasing. For 311 Reporting, API/Phone are the most common reporting style, however the reporting style does not affect the total number of citations per district. Through a cluster analysis that identified specific neighborhoods with the highest reports and citations in Baltimore, the suggested targeted interventions include improving communication and transparency with reporters, modifying the current surveillance system, and implementing a cash reward program. Future research includes comparing this data with demolition data, updating 311 data in a timely and accurate manner, and understanding how seasonality affects 311 reporting as well.

Data Findings and Interpretations
Our approach is two fold: first, we wanted to find trends from the 311 Reporting and the Environmental Citations data, and the relationships between the two datasets. Second, we identified high illegal citations and reporting ‘hotspots’ will give insight into specific areas to target on a city council district level and neighborhood level. By identifying 'hot spots', we will suggest specific areas to implement targeted interventions.

311 Reporting: The number of reports increase annually from 2014 (2,889 citations) to 2019 (10,269 citations). Geographically, District 9 had the highest number of illegal dumping citations (5,877) across all years. To dive deeper, we wanted to better understand if Baltimore has more efficient reporting methods that led to increased reporting, or if Baltimore was becoming dirtier? Of all reporting styles (AP, email, mail, phone, system, and web), API and Phone had the highest number of reportings, with Phone being consistently higher than API





We wanted to see if the type of reporting had any effect on an increase or decrease in reports. By identifying the District API:PHONE ratio compared to the number of reports, although there is higher phone use, it doesn't necessarily lead to more or less reports, lower API:PHONE ratios resulted in both high and low reports in multiple districts. Therefore, the method of reporting doesn't affect reporting quantities, but overall there is still an increase in reporting over the years (data analysis process in Appendix). 
Environmental Citations Findings. Initially we intended to only analyze the environmental citations specifically for illegal dumping but we realised that the data collected for this violation was actually corrupted. As a compromise, we focused on citations similar to illegal dumping, including Trash Accumulation and Bulk Trash citations. From 2004-2019, there is an exponential increase for both citations, again confirming the magnitude of this problem. 



Second, we conducted a cluster analysis to identify neighborhood clusters with high 311 illegal dumping reporting, and high environmental citations in Bulk Trash and Trash Accumulation. Through the analysis, five clusters were identified: Abell (1), Canton (2), Better Waverly (3)  Belair Edison (4), and Broadway East (5) . By utilizing the 311 dashboard, we mapped out the clusters with the top number of reporting and citations, which were Clusters 4  and Cluster 5. Cluster 4 was entirely Belair Edison (inside the red circle), Cluster 5 was made up of 13 neighborhoods (outside red circle, including Baltimore Highlands, Broadway East, Brooklyn, Carrollton Ridge, Central Park Heights, Coldstream Homestead Montebello, Ellwood Park/Monument, McElderry Park, Patterson Park, Washington Village/Pigtown). Overall, there is a high concentration of high illegal dumping/trash occurences in the NW region of Baltimore. If the Percent of Service Requests Closed Overtime in Clusters 4/5 continues decreasing, residents may be hesitant to report if their requests aren’t addressed as quickly.
